      <h2>THE SALMON COOKIE STORE STORY</h2>
      <p>
       Although to be fair and obvious, I would like to point out that none of these locations are real Salmon Cookie store.
       They are, however, real cookie stores in the great state of Washington. Check them out on the locations page.
      </br>
        The Salmon Cookie Store Story so far...
        the location began in Seattle when our founder, Steven McSomeguy,
        decided that he had too much money and not enough bad ideas to waste it on.
        Steven McSomeguy looked at buying a radio station [KACL], buying gold and nosecandy...
        Then McSomeguy had an idea! Take the amazing nutritional power of salmon
        and then create a calorie-packed cookie out of them in the hope that hipsters would buy them!
        They say no one ever went broke underestimating the idiocy of the public and they were right.
